# C-Program-Remove

## Description
This application is a shell script (to run on the Bourne shell) that can be used to remove some old C programs you no longer wish to keep.

This is implemented by Bash (Unix Shell), please download the code, transfer it to a Linux or Unix system, or transfer the code to a virtual machine which is installed a Linux or Unix system.

## Then input the command.

### 1. Add execute permission to delC.sh

`chmod +x delC.sh`

### 2. Execute the delC.sh

`./delC.sh`

### 3. Test the program

To illustrate the behaviour of the script, the following are sample outputs. The $ is the shell prompt. The texts in & are not part of the sample output. They are hints indicating how your script should behave
